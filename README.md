## General Information
**Problem Statement**
- As a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions, the task here is to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

- The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
 \t
| Gesture | Corresponding Action |
| --- | --- | 
| Thumbs Up | Increase the volume. |
| Thumbs Down | Decrease the volume. |
| Left Swipe | 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds. |
| Right Swipe | 'Jump' forward 10 seconds. |
| Stop | Pause the movie. |

- Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).

## Conclusions
- CNN+RNN based model with GRU cells along with Transfer Learning and data
augmentation gave the good results considering parameter size, accuracy and loss functions
trade-off.
- Transfer learning using MobileNet boosted the overall accuracy of the model.
